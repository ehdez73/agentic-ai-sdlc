## Functional Requirements

1. As a **user**, I want to be assigned a category (PLATINUM, GOLD, SILVER, BRONZE) based on the number of completed orders I have made in the last year.
2. As a **marketing team member**, I want to segment users into categories so that we can create targeted marketing campaigns that increase sales.
3. As a **system administrator**, I want the system to classify users based on the following rules:
   - PLATINUM for 20+ satisfactory orders,
   - GOLD for 15-20 satisfactory orders,
   - SILVER for 10-15 satisfactory orders,
   - BRONZE for 5-10 satisfactory orders.
4. As a **user**, I want to receive an email notification when I have been upgraded to a higher category based on my order history.
5. As a **user**, I want to be notified via email if my category is downgraded due to an order being canceled or insufficient completed orders.
6. As a **system**, I want to ensure that categorization processing is asynchronous so that it does not affect the normal purchasing flow.
7. As a **system**, I want to implement retry policies for email notifications to handle potential failures in sending out messages.
8. As a **QA**, I want to validate that if a user does not meet any category criteria, no action is taken regarding categorization.

## Gherkin Scenarios

Feature: User Category Assignment
  In order to create targeted marketing campaigns and notify users appropriately
  As a marketing team member and user
  I want to ensure users are categorized based on their order history, and notifications are sent accordingly.

  Background:
    Given a user with completed orders
    And the user has an email address
    And the system processes categorization asynchronously

  @valid
  Scenario Outline: Assigning categories based on completed orders
    Given the user has <order_count> satisfactory orders
    When the system classifies the user
    Then the user should be assigned the <category> category

    Examples:
    | order_count | category |
    | 25          | PLATINUM |
    | 18          | GOLD     |
    | 12          | SILVER   |
    | 8           | BRONZE   |

  @invalid
  Scenario Outline: No action taken when user does not meet category criteria
    Given the user has <order_count> satisfactory orders
    When the system classifies the user
    Then no category assignment should occur

    Examples:
    | order_count |
    | 3           |

  @valid
  Scenario: Notify user on upgrade
    Given the user has completed orders and is upgraded to a higher category
    When the system sends an email notification
    Then the user should receive the notification

  @invalid
  Scenario: Notify user on downgrade
    Given the user has ongoing cancellations or insufficient completed orders
    When the system sends an email notification
    Then the user should receive the notification about the category downgrade

  @feature-example
  Scenario: Handle email notification failures
    Given the user has completed orders
    When the email notification fails to send
    Then the system should implement retry policies to resend the emails.
