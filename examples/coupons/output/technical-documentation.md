# Coupon Discount Feature Documentation

## 1. Overview
The Coupon Discount feature enables users to apply discount codes during the checkout process. This functionality allows users to reduce their order total, view applied discounts, and receive notifications regarding their coupon's validity throughout their shopping experience.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- **As a user, I want to be able to enter a discount coupon code at the checkout so that I can receive a discount on my order.**
  - Users can input a coupon code to receive a discount at checkout. This impacts the payment processing and the total amount due.
  - *Example:* If a user enters a coupon code "SAVE20," they might receive a 20% discount on their order.

- **As a user, I want to see a clear error message if the coupon is invalid, expired, or does not meet the minimum purchase requirements.**
  - Users need feedback when the coupon cannot be applied. This ensures a smooth user experience and prevents confusion during the checkout process.
  
- **As a user, I want to see the applied discount and the new total reflected in the order summary after successfully applying a coupon.**
  - This requirement ensures transparency in pricing and allows users to see how much they save with the coupon.

- **As a user, I want the discount coupon to be automatically removed if the cart value falls below the minimum required for the coupon.**
  - Automatically removing the coupon when the conditions are not met helps maintain pricing integrity in the checkout process.

- **As a user, I want to be notified if my coupon no longer applies due to changes in my cart, so I understand why the discount has disappeared.**
  - Providing notifications ensures users remain informed about their total costs and the status of their coupons.

- **As a user, I want the discount coupon to persist in my session until I manually remove it or the session ends, preventing the need to re-enter it while navigating the site.**
  - This feature enhances user convenience by remembering their coupon preference as they browse.

- **As a user, I want to be able to manually remove the coupon through a clear button or icon, so I can easily change my selection.**
  - Users should have control over their coupon selections to facilitate easy adjustments without hassle.

- **As a user, I only want to be able to apply one coupon per order to simplify the checkout process.**
  - Restricting coupon usage to one ensures a straightforward checkout experience, minimizing confusion over discount calculations.

## 3. Behavior Summary
- Coupons can be applied at checkout provided they are valid and the criteria are met.
- Clear feedback is provided to users when coupons are invalid or when minimum purchase requirements are not satisfied.
- Discounts are recalculated and displayed dynamically as the cart value changes.

## 4. Categorization Rules
| Criteria                             | Description                               |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|

## 6. Gherkin Scenario Mapping
- **Successful Coupon Application**
  - **Type:** Positive
  - **Purpose:** Validate that a valid coupon code applies and shows the correct discount and total.

  - **Example:** Attempting to use "SAVE20" on a cart total of $50.

- **Cart Value Drops Below Minimum for Coupon**
  - **Type:** Valid
  - **Purpose:** Ensure that users are notified if their coupon becomes invalid due to a cart value drop.
  - **Example:** Cart total drops to $20 and the notification indicates the coupon no longer applies.

  - **Type:** Valid
  - **Purpose:** Validate the userâ€™s ability to remove a coupon and its subsequent effect on the checkout summary.
  - **Example:** User clicks the remove button; the coupon is removed, and discount no longer applies.

## 7. Asynchronous Process Notes
The implementation may involve handling asynchronous events for coupon validations, user notifications, and session management to ensure the coupon status is current. Background jobs might be necessary to handle session expiration or coupon validity checks periodically.

## 8. Additional Notes
- Ensure that coupon codes are stored securely and validated efficiently.
- Consider implementing analytics to track coupon usage and user engagement.
- Maintain clear documentation for coupon rules and expiration to assist users and customer support.
