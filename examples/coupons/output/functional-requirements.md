1. As a **user**, I want to be able to enter a discount coupon code at the checkout so that I can receive a discount on my order.
2. As a **user**, I want to see a clear error message if the coupon is invalid, expired, or does not meet the minimum purchase requirements.
3. As a **user**, I want to see the applied discount and the new total reflected in the order summary after successfully applying a coupon.
4. As a **user**, I want the discount coupon to be automatically removed if the cart value falls below the minimum required for the coupon.
5. As a **user**, I want to be notified if my coupon no longer applies due to changes in my cart, so I understand why the discount has disappeared.
6. As a **user**, I want the discount coupon to persist in my session until I manually remove it or the session ends, preventing the need to re-enter it while navigating the site.
7. As a **user**, I want to be able to manually remove the coupon through a clear button or icon, so I can easily change my selection.
8. As a **user**, I only want to be able to apply one coupon per order to simplify the checkout process.
