# Agentic SDLC POC

This project is a **Proof of Concept (POC)** that aims to supercharge the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) using agentic AI.

## Overview

The goal of this POC is to explore how agentic AI can automate, enhance, and streamline various stages of the SDLC, including requirements gathering, code generation, documentation, validation, and more.

This project uses **n8n** as the workflow automation platform to orchestrate and connect agentic AI tasks throughout the SDLC.

## Key Features
- **Agentic AI Integration:** Leverages AI agents to assist and automate SDLC tasks.
- **Workflow Automation with n8n:** Uses n8n to build and manage automated workflows for requirements, code, and documentation.
- **Extensible Prompts:** Modular prompt files for different SDLC activities.

## Project Structure
- `prompts/` — Prompt templates for various SDLC tasks
- `workflows/` — Example workflows demonstrating agentic SDLC automation
- `transciptions/` — Supporting files and documentation
- `*.yml` — Docker Compose and configuration files

## Getting Started
This is an experimental POC. Please refer to the workflow and prompt files for examples of agentic SDLC automation. To run or modify workflows, use the n8n platform as described in the workflow files.

## Disclaimer
This project is for demonstration and experimentation purposes only.
